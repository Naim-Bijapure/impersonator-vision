    On localhost, the deployer account is the one that comes with Hardhat, which is already funded.

    When deploying to live networks (e.g `yarn deploy --network goerli`), the deployer account
    should have sufficient balance to pay for the gas fees for contract creation.

    You can generate a random account with `yarn generate` which will fill DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY
    with a random private key in the .env file (then used on hardhat.config.ts)
    You can run the `yarn account` command to check your balance in every network.
